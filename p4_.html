	<p><b> Diary of a wimpy kid:The Movie</b>
	 
	 Greg Heffley has just entered seventh grade. 
	 One morning before Greg leaves for his first day of school, Frank and Susan, the latter of whom is writing a parenting column in the local newspaper, tell him and his older brother Rodrick that they need to spend more time together.
	 Susan incentivizes them with play money that they can redeem for real money. Later, a local talent show is advertised on TV, and Rodrick sees it as the big break for his band, Löded Diper.
	 At church the following Sunday, Rodrick stains Greg's pants with chocolate, making people believe that Greg defecated in his pants, humiliating him, and causing an embarrassing public scuffle between the two.
	 As punishment, the Heffley parents go to the water park, Rockin' Rapids, with the youngest Heffley boy Manny for the weekend.
	 Greg and Rodrick are left home to work on their differences; they are also instructed not to invite anyone over.
	 Defying his parents immediately upon their departure, Rodrick throws a wild party which Greg and his best friend Rowley Jefferson end up participating in.
	 The next morning, Greg and Rodrick receive a voicemail from Susan and Frank, informing them that they will be returning early from their trip due to Manny being ill, prompting them to hastily clean up the trashed house. 
	 They find that someone wrote "Rodrick Rules" on the bathroom door in permanent marker. Greg gets the idea to replace it with the door to the basement.
	 However, after their family gets home, they realize that the replacement door does not have a lock on it, whereas the previous one did.
